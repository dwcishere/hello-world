Ideas for apps

I'm a California native working on my "New Yorker" status. Been in NYC for 11 years, if the "10 years in NYC makes you a New Yorker" rule is true, I've obviously qualified. Though, if you ask me, being a New Yorker is much more about your state of mind rather than how much time you put in here. 

Other things to note: I love film (I have a film degree), music (I used to play in bands), pit bulls, Mexican food, and exploring cities.
